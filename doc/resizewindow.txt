*resizewindow.txt* More intuitive way to resize windows in Vim

INTRODUCTION					*resizewindow*

This plugin provides direction based resizing of windows.

Using <C-W>+, <C-W>-, <C-W><, and <C-W>> to resize windows can be disorienting
since <C-W>< and <C-W>> look like they should always be moving the window
divider left and right, respectively, but they don't if you're in the right
most window.
